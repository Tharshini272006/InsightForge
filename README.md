🔍 InsightForge
Smarter Answers from Your Documents

InsightForge is an AI-powered document intelligence platform that allows users to upload PDF files and ask natural-language questions strictly based on the document’s content. It eliminates manual searching, saves time, and enables faster understanding of complex documents.

Unlike generic chatbots, InsightForge does not hallucinate or use external knowledge. Every answer is grounded only in the uploaded document, making it reliable for academic, professional, and research use cases.

🚀 Why InsightForge Exists (This Is the Key Differentiator)

General-purpose AI tools like ChatGPT or Gemini are powerful, but they:
Mix external knowledge with document content
Cannot guarantee answers are strictly from the uploaded file
Are not optimized for focused document analysis

InsightForge solves this by:

Locking AI responses strictly to document context
Preventing off-topic or fabricated answers
Providing a clean, distraction-free UI for document Q&A
This makes InsightForge suitable for serious work, not casual chatting.
